## Project objective:
To analyze customer profiles and purchasing behavior for AeroFit's three treadmill models (KP281, KP481, KP781) to inform targeted marketing strategies.

### Technical summary:
- **Data Preparation:** Imported the dataset, performed initial exploratory data analysis by checking data types, missing values, and duplicates. Converted categorical variables to appropriate data types and examined the distribution of variables using descriptive statistics.
- **Univariate Analysis:** Conducted in-depth univariate analysis on both numerical and categorical variables using various visualization techniques such as distribution plots, count plots, and box plots to understand the individual characteristics of each variable.
- **Bivariate and Multivariate Analysis:** Explored relationships between variables, particularly how different features relate to the product purchased, using count plots and box plots. Performed correlation analysis and visualized it with a heatmap to identify significant relationships between numerical variables.

### Key insights:
- Analysed a dataset of `180 records` on treadmill purchases, encompassing demographics, usage, and fitness metrics.
- Identified that `44.4% of customers` preferred the `KP281` treadmill model.
- Determined the `average customer age to be 28.79 years` with a standard deviation of 6.94 years, and found that `57.8% of the customers were male`.
- Revealed that 42.2% of customers had a fitness level of 3 (on a scale of 1 to 5) and used the treadmill 3 times per week.
- Established the `median customer income as $50,597`, with a range from $29,562 to $104,581.
